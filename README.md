# ALX Frontend-Javascript
This repo is a compliation of all javascript related exercises during my alx software development short specialization journey.

## 0x03. ES6 Data manipulation
This folder consist of exercises which tests your knowledge, understanding and thinking in regards to data manipulation in data structures such as array, typed arrays, sets, map and weak maps.

## 0x04-0x04-TypeScript
This folder / directory consist of exercises which test your knowledge and skill with Typescript. Typescript shares a similairity with javascript with the only difference been type checking. Typescript helps to curtle the challenge or help avoid common errors usually encountered in javascript which is related to type. In Typescript variable type is implicitly or explicitly declared. (That is typescript, can assume the type of the variable with the programmer explicitly declaring it, or you as the programmer can tell Typescript what the type of the variable should be).
